INTRODUCTION:

Adds the companion voicelines from Owlcat Games' Pathfinder: Wrath of the Rightous to BG2:EE, BG:EE and IWD:EE for your enjoyment.

Here is a brief overview of the characters voicelines and what to roughly expect from them (May contain light spoilers for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Rightous (PF:WotR)).

Arueshalae: "I will prove my worth!"
A Chaotic/Good aligned personality. Fits well for a softspoken ranger or bard. (Includes brief mentions of Desna, a deity of Golarion.)

Camelia: "I am helpful, am I not?"
A **REDACTED** aligned personality. Should work fairly well for a shaman or a chaotically aligned rogue.

Daeran: "Smile! The world's not ending just yet."
A selfish/neutral aligned personality. Works well for any kind of spoiled brat or faux-noble character. (Brief mention of the crusade from PF:WotR)

Ember: "You're a good person. I like you."
A Neutral/True Good aligned personality. Works well for any type of mystic or childish character.

Galfrey: "Today, we'll decide tomorrow!" 
A Lawful Good Paladin/Royalty style personality. (Makes references to Iomedae, Golarion and the crusade from PF:WotR)

Greybor: "I'm your blade."
A neutrally aligned killer for hire. A consummate professional. Works well for Bounty Hunters, Assassins, Fighters, etc.

Lann: "Meditate on your mistakes. Might make you feel better."
A Lawful personality. Originally a monk in PF:WotR and it translates rather well. (He references himself as 'Lann' in his idle dialog and cracks a joke about his physical appearance in PF:WotR. You won't hear this though if you don't stand around idly for it to trigger.)

Nenio: "You should have listened to reason!"
A neutral/chaotic personality with a passion for science and experiments. Works well for any type of wizard.

Regill: "Hesitation, is a sin."
A Lawful Neutral/Lawful Evil personality. Excellent for a Blackguard. (One line references Hellknights. A fairly innocous comment though so it's likely you won't notice it.)

Seelah: "Today we march, tomorrow we feast!"
A Lawful Good/Neutral Good personality. Originally a paladin in PF:WotR but should work well with pretty much any good-aligned character.

Sosiel: "The world has suffered enough!"
A Neutral Good aligned personality with an appreciation for beauty in the world. Originally a Cleric in PF:WotR and his lines work well for any Divine/Holy adjacent warrior. (He makes references to Shelyn, the goddess of beauty of Golarion.)

Trever: "Vengeance!"
A truly chaotic personality. At times almost bestial. A personality that has seen and suffered through the worst parts of reality and emerged as a broken and scarred individual. Works great for a chaotic neutral character out for blood.

Wenduag: "I crave your commands."
A mix of subservience and ruthless survivalism. Would be perfect for an Evil Ranger, Barbarian or Rogue or just simply an evil henchman. (In her idle dialog she references the crusades in PF:WotR and refers to herself as 'Wenduag'.)

Woljif: "Hah! I win!"
A roguish personality and a bit of a goofball. Should work well for any chaotically aligned Mage/Thief combination. (His idle dialog implies that he is a Tiefling.)
